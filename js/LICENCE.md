#A personal note:
Please don't copy or distribute my game,
it's really not very nice. I trust you
to be nice people enough that I've not
put any (or very little) DRM on my game
please don't make me change that.

You're welcome to have a look at my code,
if you can read it!
but please don't copy it.

Thanks.
